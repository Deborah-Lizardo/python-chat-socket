#  Little Cats Chat 🐾

A chat made with Python using sockets. This project is a creative take on a classic chat system where users can interact, send messages to the group, or even chat privately with other users!

## Features:
- **Cute Cat Theme**: Personalized cat-themed messaging 
- **Public and Private Chats**: Send messages to everyone or have a private conversation with your favorite cats! 
- **Chat History**: See all the gossip that's been shared in the chat!( command "see gossip") 
- **Cat Nicknames**: Choose your unique cat name and enter the conversation!
  
🐾 How to Use:
- Enter a cat name when prompted to join the chat. (No spaces allowed in cat names!)
- Send messages: Type and press enter to send a message to the group.
- Private messages: Send a message to another cat by using the format $cat_name your_message.
- Type "exit" to leave the chat. 

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Sockets
- Threads
- rich for colorful terminal output

## About the Project:
This was developed as part of the **Conectividade em Sistemas Ciberfísicos** course, where I worked on the final project in a pair. During the course, I explored **Programming Logic** and **sockets** to build a fun, interactive system. This was my first experience with **sockets**, **threads**, and **rich**.
