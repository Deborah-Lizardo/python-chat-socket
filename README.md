## 💡 About the Project:
This was developed as part of the **Conectividade em Sistemas Ciberfísicos** course, where I worked on the final project in a pair. During the course, I explored **Programming Logic** and **sockets** to build a fun, interactive system. This was my first experience with **sockets**, **threads**, and **rich**, and I’m super excited to share it! 😻
